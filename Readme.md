# 🔥 Nether's Trial 🔥

***

### The Nether hides more than lava seas and blazing fortresses… 

Scattered across its depths are three mysterious teleport shrines – each one spawns naturally and leads to a different dungeon difficulty.

Inside awaits:

*   ⚔️ Three custom Ravager bosses
*   🔧 Redstone contraptions & hidden traps
*   🏃 Parkour segments to keep you on your toes
*   💡 Dark corridors & atmospheric lighting
*   🛑 In-dungeon respawn enabled by default – no more long walks back
*   💎 Custom loot rewards, including:  
      - ⚔️ The ultimate slayer sword  
      - 🛡️ God’s Protection – a divine potion  
      - 🦾 Warrior & Beast Slayer armor sets

**Every run feels unique**  
**Explore, fight, and prove yourself in the Nether’s most dangerous trial.**

💀 Remember, warrior… every journey comes with a price:

*   **Easy:** 2 Netherite Scrap / 4 Players MAX / 60min cooldown
*   **Normal:** 4 Netherite Scrap / 6 Players MAX / 1,5h cooldown
*   **Hard:** 2 Netherite Ingot / 8 Players MAX / 2h cooldown

*     _It's been created this way due to some DungeonZ limitations._
*     _Bosses/loot\_tables/price/player count/cooldown/mob spawn and their difficulty are fully configurable via .json files_
